# Generate an MVC Webpage
This brings us to our first challenge exercise for the course. I'm going to have you build another webpage for our application. You are going to be asked to build a simple webpage for our hotel that shows the staff. The staff view will be a way to see all staff, their positions, and their employee number. The view can be a simple table or you can do more if you choose. Once again we're going to create some mock data elements like we did with rooms. Eventually we're going to wire all of this into a database. The elements for our staff will be employee number which should be a string representation of a GUID, first name, last name and position like housekeeping security, front desk, et cetera. Take a look in the bin folder in the data that sequel file and you will see what those elements need to be for the position.

# Generate a Web Service
And this takes us to our second challenge exercise of this course, building a web service. So some of the criteria here for building this web service. You're going to build a web service for the staff elements just like we did for the rooms and that staff element service already exists for you based on the glass challenge exercise. You're going to use that existing service, you're going to serve data. That's all there is to it. It's a simple method in the controller. Have at it and I'll see you back here in a few.
